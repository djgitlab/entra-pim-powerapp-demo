# Graph Permissions

This demo is intended to use delegated permissions aligned to least privilege.

Document the permissions required for:

- Reading eligible roles
- Submitting activation requests
- Checking request status

Note: Actual permissions and behavior depend on tenant policy and PIM configuration.
